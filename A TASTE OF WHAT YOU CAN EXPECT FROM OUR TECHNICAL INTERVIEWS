React Native Developer Technical Interview Questions

# A TASTE OF WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM OUR TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS

How can you keep animations from being blocked on the JavaScript thread? Describe how this works and explain some of the limitations.
(intermediate)

ANSWER

By adding useNativeDriver: true to the animation options
It works by passing the animation to the native thread where it will not be blocked by the JavaScript thread
This will work on non-layout properties like opacity and transform, but will not work on things like flex, or position
Explain the re-architecture of React Native and the importance of the changes?
(hard)

ANSWER

Facebook is working internally to change the way Javascript interfaces with Native Modules. This is an overhaul of the UI-Layer, it’s codenamed “Fabric”
TurboModules will be the next iteration of NativeModules. Importantly this will ensure native modules are loaded eagerly instead of all at once avoiding startup overhead
Also, TurboModules can be called synchronously avoiding asynchronous calls across the RN bridge
Along with this change the core of React Native is going lean. Which means many libraries such as Async Storage, Geolocation and Device information are moving to separate repositories
What is a Fragment and why would you use one?
(intermediate)

ANSWER

A fragment is a way of grouping JSX elements together without adding to the render tree by wrapping them in an additional view.
A good example of where to use a fragment is in a dedicated component of a screen where no additional container styling is needed.
The benefits of using a fragment is less complex styling in some cases and less complex rendering.
What does StyleSheet.create do?
(easy)

ANSWER

StyleSheet.create method ensures that values are immutable and opaque, they are also only created once.
What are hooks and when would you use them?
(hard)

ANSWER

Hooks is a way to use stateful logic, effects, etc outside of a class.
A hook is a useful way to share stateful logic across multiple functional components, examples include: A modal’s open/closed state, Form state, and Subscribing to events
What strategy would you use to optimize a large list of items on FlatList?
(intermediate)

ANSWER

Use PureComponent on renderItem with bind methods
Add keyExtractor property
Add pagination
Define getItemLayout
Define removeClippedSubviews true
Can you provide some ideas on how to prevent memory leaks in your app?
(intermediate)

ANSWER

Release timers/listeners added in componentDidMount
Handle closure scope
Do you know how can you detect memory leaks on the app?
(advanced)

ANSWER

Xcode and Android studio provide tools to track the memory used by an app. These tools can be used to test the app on both devices and simulators.
How can you improve the performance (load speed, rendering quality) of images?
(easy)

ANSWER

Server-side compression
Third-party tools such as Cloudinary
Image caching
Name at least one style property that can increase tappable area around an element
(easy)

ANSWER

padding (and also paddingVertical, ...Horizontal, ...Left, ...Right, ...Top, ...Bottom)
minHeight and minWidth
hitSlop
Make Tappleble Areas Larger
